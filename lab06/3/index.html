                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the foundation of every website you see on the internet. It's the language that tells your web browser how to display text, images, links, and other elements on a page. Think of it as the skeleton of a website, providing the basic structure and organization.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that takes the raw structure of HTML and adds the visual flair. It's like the paint and decorations that turn the skeleton of a website into a beautiful and engaging experience for users.

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    JavaScript is the language that brings websites to life, adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and responsiveness to web pages. It's like the magic that makes websites more engaging and enjoyable to use.

                <h3>Tailwind</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    Tailwind is a little different from the other terms you've mentioned! It's not a fundamental web technology like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but rather a utility-first CSS framework. This means it provides a collection of pre-built, low-level CSS classes that you can use to quickly and easily style your web pages.
